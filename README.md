# unique-birthdays

My solutions for Chapter 3 Exercises 7a-7c of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

An example in Subsection 3.8.3 tried to answer the question, How many random people
do you have to select before you find a duplicate birthday? The source code for that program
can be found in the file BirthdayProblem.java. Here are some related questions:
• How many random people do you have to select before you find three people who
share the same birthday? (That is, all three people were born on the same day in
the same month, but not necessarily in the same year.)
• Suppose you choose 365 people at random. How many different birthdays will they
have? (The number could theoretically be anywhere from 1 to 365).
• How many different people do you have to check before you’ve found at least one
person with a birthday on each of the 365 days of the year?
Write three programs to answer these questions. Each of your programs should sim-
ulate choosing people at random and checking their birthdays. (In each case, ignore the
possibility of leap years.)


NOTE: The problem asked for different programs for each solution because the book had not yet introduced subroutines. 
However, I was already familiar with them, so chose to write three functions (plus a main() function) instead.
